Predictions for the 2016 ASA Election Prediction Contest

http://thisisstatistics.org/electionprediction2016/

From the ASA: 

With the presidential election less than three months away, an exciting opportunity awaits for statistics to demonstrate its significance and value, and students can play an exciting role! The American Statistical Association (ASA), through its public education initiative, ThisIsStatistics, has launched Prediction 2016, a contest for high school and undergraduate students throughout the United States to predict the winner of the presidential election in each state and the District of Columbia.
 
Each winning entry will receive a $200 cash prize, and all members of the winning group will receive a complementary ASA membership and a 2016 Election Prediction t-shirt. In addition, winners will have an opportunity to feature their work in a guest column of Sense About Science USA, a nonprofit organization that creates and curates a national conversation about the value of scientific progress and the importance of evidence and transparency. Winners also will be profiled and promoted to ASAâ€™s membership of leading statisticians and data scientists in academia, industry, business, and government, and through ThisIsStatistics.org. Second and third place winners also will be recognized.
 
Submissions must be received by 5 p.m. on October 24, and contest winners will be announced on November 9, the day after Election Day. 
 
While political pundits and prognosticators often rely on observational data, statistics has the power to yield greater insight into not only who will be the 45th president but also educate Americans about the dynamics and complexities of the election process. We look forward to learning who your students predict will next hold the office of the U.S. presidency.
